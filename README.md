# Image Segmentation Validation using Keras and OpenCV

This project is focused on validating a pre-trained image segmentation model using Keras and OpenCV. It includes steps for loading the model, normalizing images, and evaluating model performance on validation data. The results are visualized using various plots to analyze the segmentation accuracy and error distribution.

## Features

- **Model Loading**: Use TensorFlow and Keras to load pre-trained models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize images before feeding them to the model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as IOU (Intersection Over Union) to assess segmentation quality.
- **Visualization**: Leverage Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize segmentation results and performance metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
