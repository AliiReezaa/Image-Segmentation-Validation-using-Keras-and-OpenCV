# Image-Segmentation-Validation-using-Keras-and-OpenCV
This project validates image segmentation models using Keras and OpenCV. The notebook demonstrates how to load a pre-trained model, normalize images, and use various metrics and visualizations for evaluating segmentation performance. The project also includes plots generated with Matplotlib and Seaborn .
